                    <p>What does it do ? It helps you if you have to switch between personal hotspot and your network a lot, for instance.<br />It disables and enables your interfaces to make you switch from network A to network B.<br />This can be a very big app but I only made it so it responds to what I want it to do.</p>

                    <p>It all started in the end of 2017, me and some friends started making a Minecraft Server (as every kid at this time). It was a cheap server but I started doing every games in Skript (A simplified Minecraft coding language).<br />The server was based on the Rush minigame that is played (and still played now) by 50-60% of the French MC community. And after almost a year, it closed because I wasn't playing MC anymore.</p>

                    <p>And there we go, nostalgia hits and me and a friend, in January 2019 we decide to restart from <b>ZERO</b>, and recreate all but better. Only ProtocolLib as external plugin, every plugin will be made by <u>US</u>. Time flies and the server is almost ready but we dont really wanna keep working on it, idk if it will come a day but with this year of hard-work, we learned a lot, was fun.</p>
                    <h2 class="sub-heading">Not only a server, a whole network</h2>
                    <p>That's right, I worked myself a lot on the website. But this one is special, it is the center of the network, the plans where to have synchronized accounts between MC, the Website and the Discord Server (Spoiler: it is done). With that, you can chat with everyone on every platform, your IG rank doesn't only give you IG perks, but also Discord rewards and websites things. We can (with webhooks and a JSONAPI) control the network from the Website's admin panel, we can ban members from the network, write news, open/close/whitelist users etc...</p>
                    <p>All of this data where stored and synchronized between the website database and a MC plugin entierly made made by <u>@Thalrod_</u>.</p>
                    <p>Current project progress:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Website : 90%</li>
                        <li>Discord bot and webhooks : 30%</li>

                    <p>PROJECT UPDATE: I will eventually release a GUI version of WazeDecoy, with that you will be able to place any decoy anywhere.</p>
                    <p>This is a C# program that, yes, place decoys on Waze. With that I place police around my house so people "slow down", at the beggining it was quite a joke but it turned into a reality.</p>
                    <p>To achieve that, I used web proxy software to intercept Waze requests with its Protobuf API (www.rtproxy.waze) and I basically copied the login commands and the decoy placing command. No API token or anything, and I can also place decoy everywhere I want and create virtual traffic jams without being there.</p>
                    <p>This flaw is really powerfull and can lead to false informations in the app, or just by totally flooding the Waze map by fake reports.</p>

                    <p>And I installed the program on a Raspberry Pi Zero (on raspbian buster) to make it run 24/7. (It's still C#, I used <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/" target="_blank">Mono</a> to run it on Raspbian.)</p>
